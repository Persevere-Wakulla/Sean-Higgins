# program

Paper trading / viewing application made to make trading less intimidating. The goal is the ability to learn technicals, to get comfortable and to see how often your trades work out, that way when you actually start trading with real money you won't lose everything.

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
